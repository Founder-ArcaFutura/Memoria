Personal Fitness Coach Agent with Memory

This example demonstrates how to use the Memoria ToolKit with Agno Agents
to create a personal fitness coach that remembers your goals, preferences,
workouts, and progress across conversations.

Run `pip install -e .` followed by `pip install agno` to install dependencies

Model selection is handled via ``memoria.json``. Edit
``agents.default_model`` to change the underlying model.
